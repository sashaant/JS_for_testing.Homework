1) Rewrite if with (using Ternary operator)

let result;
if (a + b < 10) {
  result = 'Few';
} else {
  result = 'Many';
}

RESULT:
let a = 1;
let b = 2;

let reuslt = a + b < 10 ? "Few" : "Many";

console.log(result)




2) Write an if condition to verify that the age variable is between 18 and 90 inclusive.
Inclusive means that the value of age can be either 18 or 90.

let age = 100;
if (age < 18 && age < 90) {
    console.log("Valid ")
}
else {
    console.log("Invalid")
}
