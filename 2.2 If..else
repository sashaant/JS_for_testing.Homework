2) Write an if condition to verify that the age variable is between 18 and 90 inclusive.
Inclusive means that the value of age can be either 18 or 90.

//RESULT_1
let age = 100;
if (age <= 18 && age <= 90) {
    console.log("Valid ")
}
else {
    console.log("Invalid")
}



//RESULT_2

let age = prompt('What is your age ');
const isAgeAcceptable = age > 18 && < 90;

if (isAgeAcceptable){
    alert('Nice age')
};
else{
    alert('You are too small')
};

console.log(age)
